Hospital Compare Downloadable Database
Generally, health policy researchers and the media download the Hospital Compare database as an easy way to obtain a large set of data. The data in the Downloadable Database come from the data that are displayed on Hospital Compare, but also include additional information about the hospital ownership that is not displayed on the website. If you want information about hospitals in a particular geographical area, you should use the Hospital Compare tool instead of downloading the data.
Note: Opening CSV files in Excel will remove leading zeros from data fields. Since some Hospital Provider Identification Numbers contain leading zeros, we recommend that you open CSV files using text editor programs such as Notepad to copy or view CSV file content.
Date Refreshes: Generally, the downloadable databases are refreshed at the same time as the data on Hospital Compare; however, there are times when it could take an additional 24 hours to update.
• You can tell when the Hospital Compare data has been updated by looking in the bottom left corner of the home page.
• The date the downloadable database is updated is also shown on the home page under “Additional Information” on the right side of the page.
• The date “Modified” in the zipped file only indicates the date the data was last manipulated, not the date it was posted to the site.
You can also find Hospital Compare data on data.medicare.gov. This website allows you to view the data files embedded on a webpage without downloading them. The data on data.medicare.gov can usually be viewed the same day it has been updated on Hospital Compare. Use data.medicare.gov to customize views and filter the Hospital Compare data.
Note: Beginning in July 2013, the platform for the Hospital Compare data sets will be data.medicare.gov. The downloadable databases will not be available after that time.
